# Transfer Reinforcement Learning

This is the supplementary files for final project of BU EC500 K1 / CS591 S2
Deep Learning, Transfer Reinforcement Learning. The A3C algorithms in this repo
is based on [@miyosuda](https://github.com/miyosuda/async_deep_reinforc).

## 1. Obtain the expert RL agent
run a3c.py in *example* folder. You can change games' name in the script.

## 2. Perform policy regression
run either actor_mimic.py or learn_from_demo.py in *example* folder.
You can change task id in the script for different kinds of task.

## 3. Retrain A3C agent
run either retrain_a3c.py in *example* folder.
You can change task id in the script for different kinds of task.
